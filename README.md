## 🎨 Customization

### Modifying the Template
- Replace `public/card_photo.png` with your own template design
- Adjust photo positioning in `Card.js` if necessary
- Modify colors in `App.css` to match your template

### Styling
The app uses a purple color scheme that can be modified in `App.css`:
- Primary: `#6A0572` (Deep Purple)
- Secondary: `#8B008B` (Dark Magenta)
- Background: Linear gradient `#f5f7fa` to `#c3cfe2`

1. **PDF Generation Problems**
   - Ensure all images have loaded completely
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Try using Chrome for best compatibility

2. **Image Upload Issues**
   - Use JPG or PNG formats
   - Image size should preferably be under 5MB
   - Ensure your browser is up to date

3. **Responsive Layout Issues**
   - Try refreshing the page
   - Test in different browsers
   - Check CSS media queries in developer tools
